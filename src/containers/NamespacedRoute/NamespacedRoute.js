  There is no equivalent of the v5 `useRouteMatch` in v6 so we have to provide
  our own to get the currently matched route. A future release may provide something
  we can use but for now we rely on an internal API that's provided as an escape
  hatch for exactly this reason. We'll have to be careful with future updates to
  ensure this continues to work or switch to an alternative if needed.
