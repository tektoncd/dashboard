## Before you begin

Before you begin, make sure the following tools are installed:

1. [`kind`](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/): For creating a local cluster running on top of docker.
1. [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/): For interacting with your kubernetes cluster.

Nothing more is required to run the walkthrough !

## Creating a local Kubernetes cluster

The first thing to do is to create a Kubernetes cluster.

Kind is an easy solution to run a local cluster, all it needs is to have `docker` installed.

Create a cluster by running the following command:

```bash
kind create cluster --name walkthrough --config - <<EOF
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
- role: control-plane
  kubeadmConfigPatches:
  - |
    kind: InitConfiguration
    nodeRegistration:
      kubeletExtraArgs:
        node-labels: "ingress-ready=true"
  extraPortMappings:
  - containerPort: 80
    hostPort: 80
    protocol: TCP
  - containerPort: 443
    hostPort: 443
    protocol: TCP
EOF
```

This will create a cluster with ports 80 and 443 exposed on the host computer. This is needed to communicate with the ingress controller later when [Installing NGINX ingress controller](#installing-nginx-ingress-controller).

Once the cluster is started, you can check that the context was added in your kubeconfig file by running:

```bash
kubectl config get-contexts
```

The output should look something like this:

```bash
CURRENT   NAME                                                 CLUSTER                          AUTHINFO                               NAMESPACE
*         kind-walkthrough                                     kind-walkthrough                 kind-walkthrough                       
```

The `kind-walkthrough` is the context for the cluster you just created and the `*` at the beginning means that it is the currently active context.

You can verify that the ports were correctly mapped by `docker` by running `docker ps`. The output should show something like this:

```bash
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS             PORTS                                                                 NAMES
eaf0af7569e6        kindest/node:v1.17.0   "/usr/local/bin/entrâ€¦"   32 minutes ago      Up 32 minutes       0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp, 0.0.0.0:443->443/tcp, 127.0.0.1:32770->6443/tcp   walkthrough-control-plane
```

## Installing NGINX ingress controller

Now that the cluster is up and running, you will need to install an ingress controller to expose services running inside the cluster to the outside world.

The ingress controller used in this walkthrough is [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx), see [Ingress Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/) for other available solutions.

Install nginx ingress controller by running the following commands:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-0.32.0/deploy/static/provider/kind/deploy.yaml

kubectl wait -n ingress-nginx \
  --for=condition=ready pod \
  --selector=app.kubernetes.io/component=controller \
  --timeout=90s
```

The ingress controller should be up and ready to process requests.

## Installing Tekton Pipelines

Tekton Dashboard requires to have Tekton Pipelines installed.

Installing the latest Tekton Pipelines release is done by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply --filename https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/pipeline/latest/release.yaml

kubectl wait -n tekton-pipelines \
  --for=condition=ready pod \
  --selector=app.kubernetes.io/part-of=tekton-pipelines,app.kubernetes.io/component=controller \
  --timeout=90s
```

Tekton Pipelines should be up and running.

## Installing Tekton Triggers (optional)

Installing Tekton Triggers is not mandatory, if you don't want to install Tekton Triggers, you can skip this section.
If you don't install Tekton Triggers, triggers related resources won't show up in the side nav.

Installing the latest Tekton Triggers release is done by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply --filename https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/triggers/latest/release.yaml

kubectl wait -n tekton-pipelines \
  --for=condition=ready pod \
  --selector=app.kubernetes.io/part-of=tekton-triggers,app.kubernetes.io/component=controller \
  --timeout=90s
```

Tekton Triggers should be up and running.

## Installing Tekton Dashboard

Installing the latest Tekton Dashboard release is done by running the following command:

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tektoncd/dashboard/master/scripts/release-installer | \
   bash -s -- install latest

kubectl wait -n tekton-pipelines \
  --for=condition=ready pod \
  --selector=app.kubernetes.io/part-of=tekton-dashboard,app.kubernetes.io/component=dashboard \
  --timeout=90s
```

Tekton Dashboard should be up and running.

## Setting up an Ingress rule to access the Dashboard

To access the Dashboard through the ingress controller it is necessary to set up an ingress rule. The ingress rule maps a host name to the Tekton Dashboard service running inside the cluster.

For the sake of simplicity we will use the freely available [`nip.io`](https://nip.io/) service to construct a URL pointing to our local cluster.

Assuming the following url `http://tekton-dashboard.127.0.0.1.nip.io`, run the following command to create the ingress rule:

```bash
kubectl apply -n tekton-pipelines -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: tekton-dashboard
spec:
  rules:
  - host: tekton-dashboard.127.0.0.1.nip.io
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          serviceName: tekton-dashboard
          servicePort: 9097
EOF
```

Browse `http://tekton-dashboard.127.0.0.1.nip.io` to access your dashboard.

**NOTE:** Alternatively you can use the `--ingress-url` argument when invoking the `installer` script to create the `Ingress` resource:

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tektoncd/dashboard/master/scripts/release-installer | \
   bash -s -- install latest --ingress-url tekton-dashboard.127.0.0.1.nip.io

kubectl wait -n tekton-pipelines \
  --for=condition=ready pod \
  --selector=app.kubernetes.io/part-of=tekton-dashboard,app.kubernetes.io/component=dashboard \
  --timeout=90s
```

## Importing resources from a Github repository

The Tekton Dashboard can import resources directly from a GitHub repository.

Open `http://tekton-dashboard.127.0.0.1.nip.io/#/importresources` and fill in the form:

- **Repository URL**: https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline
- **Repository directory**: examples/v1beta1/pipelineruns/output-pipelinerun.yaml
- **Target namespace**: tekton-pipelines
- **Namespace**: tekton-pipelines
- **ServiceAccount**: tekton-dashboard

Then click the **Import and Apply** button to launch the importing `PipelineRun`.

You should see a `PipelineRun` running when looking at the PipelineRuns page (`http://tekton-dashboard.127.0.0.1.nip.io/#/pipelineruns`), this is the `PipelineRun` responsible for importing the resources from the GitHub repository.

## Viewing and managing resources from the Dashboard

After importing resources from the previous step, `PipelineRun`s, `TaskRun`s, `PipelineResource`s, should start running in your cluster.

You can view resource lists, individual resource details, `PipelineRun` and `TaskRun` logs, start new `PipelineRuns` or `TaskRuns`, delete resources, etc...

## Cleaning up

To clean everything up, run the following command:

```bash
kind delete cluster --name walkthrough
```
