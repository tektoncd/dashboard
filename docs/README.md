## Overview

Tekton provides a component, Tekton Dashboard, as a general-purpose,
web-based UI for Tekton Pipelines, which allows developers to:

* View and manage **taskRuns** and **pipelineRuns**
* View and manage resources associated with **taskRuns** and **pipelineRuns**
in their creation, execution, and completion

## Tutorial

Try out the [tutorial](https://katacoda.com/ncskier/scenarios/tekton-dashboard)

some of its features.

The latest release **may not be compatible** with your Tekton Pipelines
installation, should you have an earlier release of Tekton Pipelines
installed. For more compatibility information, see the
[Tekton Dashboard's "Which version should I use?"](https://github.com/tektoncd/dashboard#which-version-should-i-use)
section.

If you would like to install an earlier release of Tekton Dashboard
for compatibility reasons, see the note below.

{{% alert title="Note" color="success" %}}
To install a different release of Tekton Dashboard, find the `.yaml` file
you would like to use on the [Tekton Dashboard Releases](https://github.com/tektoncd/dashboard/releases)
page, and run the command below:

```bash
# Replace YOUR-RELEASE with the URL of the release you would like to use.
kubectl apply --filename YOUR-RELEASE
```
{{% /alert %}}

It may take a few moments before the installation completes. You can check
the progress with the following command:

```sh
kubectl get pods --namespace tekton-pipelines
```

Confirm that every component listed has the status `Running`.

## Usage

Tekton Dashboard is accessible through its `cluster IP` type service with
a [reverse proxy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/http-proxy-access-api/).
Run the following command:

```bash
kubectl proxy --port=8080
```

And you can open the dashboard in your browser under the address

```
localhost:8080/api/v1/namespaces/tekton-pipelines/services/tekton-dashboard:http/proxy/
```

It is also possible to set up port forwarding with Tekton Dashboard:

```bash
kubectl --namespace tekton-pipelines port-forward svc/tekton-dashboard 9097:9097
```

Once set up, the dashboard is available in the browser under the address
`localhost:9097`.

## What's next

Tekton Dashboard provides many features such as Webhook extension (for setting
up a GitHub repository with a Tekton pipeline in the UI), TLS support, and
Ingress support. For more information, see the
[Tekton Dashboard GitHub repository](https://github.com/tektoncd/dashboard).
