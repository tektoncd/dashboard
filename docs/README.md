## Overview

Tekton Dashboard is a general-purpose, web-based UI for 
[Tekton Pipelines](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline) and 
[Tekton triggers](https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers) resources.

It allows users to manage and view Tekton resource creation, execution, and completion.

Some of the features the Dashboard supports:
- Realtime view of `PipelineRun` and `TaskRun` status and logs.
- Filter lists of resources by label.
- View resource details and YAML.
- Show resources for the whole cluster or limit visibility to a particular namespace.
- Import resources directly from a git repository.
- Add functionality using extensions.


## Tutorial

The latest release **may not be compatible** with your Tekton Pipelines
installation, should you have an earlier release of Tekton Pipelines
installed. For more compatibility information, see the
[Tekton Dashboard's "Which version should I use?"](https://github.com/tektoncd/dashboard#which-version-should-i-use)
section.

If you would like to install an earlier release of Tekton Dashboard
for compatibility reasons, see the note below.

To install a different release of Tekton Dashboard, find the `.yaml` file
you would like to use on the [Tekton Dashboard Releases](https://github.com/tektoncd/dashboard/releases)
page, and run the command below:

```bash
kubectl apply --filename <release-url>
```
where `<release-url>` is the URL of the release you would like to use.

{{% /alert %}}

It may take a few moments before the installation completes. You can check
the progress with the following command:

```sh
kubectl get pods --namespace tekton-pipelines
```

Confirm that every component listed has the status `Running`.

## Usage

Tekton Dashboard is accessible through its `cluster IP` service with
a [reverse proxy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/http-proxy-access-api/).
Run the following command:

```bash
kubectl proxy --port=8080
```

Then you can open the Dashboard in your browser at

http://localhost:8080/api/v1/namespaces/tekton-pipelines/services/tekton-dashboard:http/proxy/

Alternatively, you can use port forwarding:

```bash
kubectl --namespace tekton-pipelines port-forward svc/tekton-dashboard 9097:9097
```

Once set up, the Dashboard is available in the browser at
http://localhost:9097
