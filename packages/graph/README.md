## Getting started

To install `@tektoncd/dashboard-graph` in your project, you will need to run the following
command using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm install -S @tektoncd/dashboard-graph
```

If you prefer [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), use the following command
instead:

```bash
yarn add @tektoncd/dashboard-graph
```

You will also need to install the Carbon packages which provide the base styling and components:
- [Carbon Components React](https://carbondesignsystem.com/developing/frameworks/react)

See the `@tektoncd/dashboard-components` documentation for details of setting up Sass for styling.

## Usage

To use a component, you can import it directly from the package:

```jsx
import { Graph } from '@tektoncd/dashboard-graph';

function MyComponent() {
  return <Graph edges={â€¦} nodes={â€¦} />;
}
```

To include the styles for the graph components:

```scss
@import '@tektoncd/dashboard-graph/src/components/newGraph.scss';
```

This will likely be separated out in future so that styles for each component can be imported separately.
