# Tekton Dashboard CI/CD

_Why do Tekton projects have a folder called `tekton`? Cuz we think it would be cool
if the `tekton` folder were the place to look for CI/CD logic in most repos!_

We dogfood our project by using Tekton to build, test, and release
Tekton! This directory contains the
[`Tasks`](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/main/docs/tasks.md) and
[`Pipelines`](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/main/docs/pipelines.md)
that we use.

## Create an official release

To create an official release, follow the steps in the [release-cheat-sheet](./release-cheat-sheet.md)

## Nightly releases

The nightly release pipeline is
[triggered nightly by Tekton](https://github.com/tektoncd/plumbing/tree/main/tekton).

This uses the same `Pipeline` and `Task`s as an official release.

## Setup

To start from scratch and use these `Pipeline`s and `Task`s:

1. [Install Tekton](#install-tekton)
1. [Setup the Tasks and Pipelines](#install-tasks-and-pipelines)
1. [Create the required service account + secrets](#service-account-and-secrets)

### Install Tekton

```bash
# If this is your first time installing Tekton in the cluster you might need to give yourself permission to do so
kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-binding-someusername \
  --clusterrole=cluster-admin \
  --user=$(gcloud config get-value core/account)

# Example, Tekton v0.29.0
export TEKTON_VERSION=0.29.0
kubectl apply --filename  https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/pipeline/previous/v${TEKTON_VERSION}/release.yaml
```

### Install tasks and pipelines

Add all the `Tasks` to the cluster, including the
[`git-clone`](https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog/tree/main/task/git-clone) and 
[`gcs-upload`](https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog/tree/main/task/gcs-upload)
Tasks from the
[`tektoncd/catalog`](https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog), and the
[release](https://github.com/tektoncd/plumbing/tree/main/tekton/resources/release) Tasks from
[`tektoncd/plumbing`](https://github.com/tektoncd/plumbing).

Use a version of the [`tektoncd/catalog`](https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog)
tasks that is compatible with version of Tekton being released, usually `main`.
Install Tasks from plumbing too:

```bash
# Apply the Tasks we are using from the catalog
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tektoncd/catalog/main/task/git-clone/0.2/git-clone.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tektoncd/catalog/main/task/gcs-upload/0.1/gcs-upload.yaml
# Apply the Tasks we are using from tektoncd/plumbing
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tektoncd/plumbing/main/tekton/resources/release/base/prerelease_checks.yaml
```

Apply the tasks from the `dashboard` repo:
```bash
# Apply the Tasks and Pipelines we use from this repo
kubectl apply -f tekton/build.yaml
kubectl apply -f tekton/publish.yaml
kubectl apply -f tekton/release-pipeline.yaml
```

`Tasks` and `Pipelines` from this repo are:

- [`build.yaml`](build.yaml) - This `Task` builds the UI bundles and places them
  in the `kodata` directory to be picked up by the backend
- [`publish.yaml`](publish.yaml) - This `Task` uses
  [`ko`](https://github.com/google/ko) to build all of the container images we
  release and generate the `release.yaml`
- [`release-pipeline.yaml`](./release-pipeline.yaml) - This `Pipeline`
  uses the above `Task`s

### Service account and secrets

In order to release, these Pipelines use the `release-right-meow` service account,
which uses `release-secret` and has
[`Storage Admin`](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/access-control)
access to
[`tekton-releases`]((https://github.com/tektoncd/plumbing/blob/main/gcp.md))
and
[`tekton-releases-nightly`]((https://github.com/tektoncd/plumbing/blob/main/gcp.md)).

After creating these service accounts in GCP, the kubernetes service account and
secret were created with:

```bash
KEY_FILE=release.json
GENERIC_SECRET=release-secret
ACCOUNT=release-right-meow

# Connected to the `prow` in the `tekton-releases` GCP project
GCP_ACCOUNT="$ACCOUNT@tekton-releases.iam.gserviceaccount.com"

# 1. Create a private key for the service account
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create $KEY_FILE --iam-account $GCP_ACCOUNT

# 2. Create kubernetes secret, which we will use via a service account and directly mounting
kubectl create secret generic $GENERIC_SECRET --from-file=./$KEY_FILE

# 3. Add the docker secret to the service account
kubectl patch serviceaccount $ACCOUNT \
  -p "{\"secrets\": [{\"name\": \"$GENERIC_SECRET\"}]}"
```

## NPM Packages

To release a new version of the npm packages, e.g. `@tektoncd/dashboard-components`:

1. ensure you have the relevant commit checked out and that you're at the root of the project
1. `npm --workspaces version <version>` where version is a valid semver string, e.g. `0.24.1-alpha.0`
1. `npm --workspaces publish`
1. enter your OTP when prompted
1. once the packages are published run `npm install`
1. stage and commit the changes to the package.json and package-lock.json files and open a new PR to record the release
