## Proposing features

If you have an idea for a feature, or if you have a solution for an existing
issue that involves an API or UI change, we highly suggest that you propose the
changes before implementing them.

This is for two main reasons:

1. [Yes is forever](https://twitter.com/solomonstre/status/715277134978113536)
2. It's easier/cheaper to make changes before implementation (and you'll feel
   less emotionally invested!)

Post in the #dashboard channel on [slack](https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/main/contact.md#slack)
or create a [new issue](https://github.com/tektoncd/dashboard/issues/new/choose) and fill in the feature request template.

A great proposal will include:

- **The use case(s) it solves** Who needs this and why?
- **Requirements** What needs to be true about the solution?
- **Alternative proposals** Even if alternatives aren't obvious, forcing
  yourself to brainstorm a couple more approaches may give you new ideas or make
  clear that your initial proposal is the best one

Also feel free to reach out to us on [slack](https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/main/contact.md#slack) if you want any help/guidance.

Thanks so much!!
